To all VITA and DM staff:

Please find below the announcement of Mark Dieckmann's docent seminar. It is
an important step in the academic career to reach the "double doctor" level.
It would be nice if as many as possible of the VITA and DM staff attend this
academic celebration.

Best regards, 

Anders
